# The CESYSGEN conditions below correspond to operating system
# components, and should match the conditions in platform.bib.
# 
# These conditions are used to express dependencies of drivers
# on operating system components.  For example, below we avoid
# compiling streamdriver unless the device manager component is
# present.
#
# The mappings from SYSGEN variables (which select operating system
# components) to MODULES are primarily found in
# public\CEBase\oak\misc.  In this case, SYSGEN_DEVICE=1 will lead
# to CE_MODULES_DEVICE being set.
