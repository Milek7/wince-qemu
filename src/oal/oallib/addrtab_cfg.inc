;  This file is used to define g_oalAddressTable. This table is passed to
;  KernelStart to estabilish physical to virtual memory mapping. This table
;  is used also in memory OAL module to map between physical and virtual
;  memory addresses via OALPAtoVA/OALVAtoPA functions.
;
;  The config.bib file defines image memory layout ant it contains virtual
;  cached memory addresses which must be synchronized with g_oalAddressTable.
;  With each table change make sure that those constant are still valid.
