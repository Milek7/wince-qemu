Welcome to the BSP Config Files Template.

This template describes the configuration files necessary for a functional BSP.
It will explain the purpose of the BSP configuration files as well as the
general function of each BSP configuration file.

At a high level, the goal of the BSP configuration files are to provide
the build system with the information necessary to run the Windows CE
operating system on the target device. To do this, the build system needs
to lay out the operating system such that it can be placed in the device
memory and the device can begin executing it.

To do this a few different pieces of information are necessary:
1. Information about the device's memory
2. Information about what operating system modules and applications
   should be placed in the device's memory.
3. Information to initialize the device's registry

Using this information, the build system will create a binary image of
the operating system that can be placed in device memory and executed.

The build system also needs a few configuration files to assist it
with building the BSP source code.

Types of Configuration Files
Binary Image Builder (.bib) files
These files define the modules that will be included in the operating
system as well as the memory layout of the image.  The BSP files are
combined with .bib files for the operating system code to form a master
list of what modules are included in the image.

Registry (.reg) files
These files define the initial registry of the image.  Many drivers
rely on registry entries during initialization.  The BSP files are
combined with .reg files for the operating system code to form a master
registry for the image.  Registry entries in the BSP configuration files
supercede the operating system registry.

File System (.dat) files
These files define the initial file system directories, files,
and links for the default RAM-based filesystem (as known as the object
store).  The BSP files are combined with .dat files from the operating
system code to form the master list for RAM file system initialization.

List of BSP Configuration Files
The BSP Configuration files are located in a few different places, so their
locations will be listed with their description and whether they are required
or optional for a functional BSP.  See each file for more detailed
descriptions.

REQUIRED
\files\config.bib
This file defines the memory layout of the device so that the tools know
where to place modules in the image.

REQUIRED
\files\platform.bib
REQUIRED
This file defines which files and applications are included in the image.

REQUIRED
\files\platform.reg
This file defines the initial registry of the image.

REQUIRED
\files\platform.db
This file defines any platform-specific databases to be included in the
RAM-based database in the image.

REQUIRED
\files\platform.dat
This file defines custom values for the RAM-based filesystem.

REQUIRED
\sources.cmn
This file defines common rules inherited by all SOURCES files in the BSP.

REQUIRED
\cesysgen\makefile
This file runs custom build actions before and after the BSP compiles.
It is used to filter the platform.bib and platform.reg files
according to which operating system components have been included.

OPTIONAL
\BSPTemplate.bat
This file sets initial build environment settings used whenever the BSP
is built.  Its name must match the directory name of the BSP.
