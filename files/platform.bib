; The MODULES section describes which executable modules are
; included in the image and which memory regions they are loaded in.
; The memory regions are described in config.bib.

MODULES

; The following are examples of drivers that you might find in a typical
; platform.bib file.  There are two types of conditional statements that
; determine whether the given module will be included by the build system.
;
; The CESYSGEN statements condition platform.bib based upon whether
; the operating system component named in the conditional (such as
; CE_MODULES_GIISR) is available in the current operating system
; configuration - i.e. what has been selected in the catalog.  Correct
; use of these conditionals ensures that the BSP will be buildable
; regardless of which operating system components are selected.
;
; The CESYSGEN statements are filtered before the BSP builds by the
; cefilter program which interprets them based upon the ceconfig.h
; file generated to the $(SG_OUTPUT_ROOT) directory by the operating
; system when components are selected and built.  These statements
; are always commented out with ; and follow the format shown below.
;
; The second type of statements are IF statements that are interpreted
; by the makeimg process, which is the last process the build system
; executes.  These statements are used for customizing the BSP
; dynamically.  Using this logic, it is possible to include
; or exclude components by changing environment variables and
; re-running makeimg.  Defaults for these environment variables
; are set in the BSPTemplate.bat file.
;
; By contrast, the CESYSGEN statements are already set by the time
; makeimg runs.
;
; The format for including a module in the image is as follows:
; Name: the destination name the module will have on the device
; Path: the source path to the module
; Memory: the memory region (see config.bib) the module will be placed in
; Type: flags for the module - see MSDN for a detailed description
;
; Platform.bib generally includes drivers for the platform.  Of particular
; note, it decides whether the driver will be loaded in kernel or user
; mode based on the presence of the "K" flag in the Type field.  Most
; drivers will also need platform.reg entries describing their properties.
;
; Note the following drivers are samples from the operating system.
; Most platforms use platform-specific drivers in addition to
; drivers from the operating system.  The operating system uses its
; own .bib files to include operating system modules, but platform.bib
; is typically responsible for including all drivers (including
; operating system samples).
